# Calculator
Compiler to scan, parse and evaluate an arithmetic expression, and print the resulting value.

1. calc.l: Scanner written in flex
2. calc.y: Parser written in bison
3. main.c: Driver code
4. makefile: Compiles and runs the above 3 files

To use the calculator, running just the makefile is sufficient. All 4 files must be in the same directory.
